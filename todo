Demo

- tracking component with activity log []
- main screen (navigatable)
- - start component
- - test component
- - - requires fullscreen mode [PENDING]

---

- - end component

The money is when:

- i can customise different questions for different teachers

Anti-cheating:

- synthetic copy event: https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#clipboard-event-copy
- mouse in/out COULD be useful: https://poe.com/preview/cQGKGogSGN6zKzvR23aH

Think about:

- students will copy and paste in text area -> i want them to do that. But this will show in Activity log
- students might accidentally click Cmd D which is create bookmark,
